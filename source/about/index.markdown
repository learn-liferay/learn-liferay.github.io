#About Me

I've been doing software engineering for ~~10~~ ~~20~~ 25+ years. Why? Because I still enjoy learning something new every day and growing my skills. Not every job lets you do that!

Throughout my career I've worked at Fortune 500 companies, for small startups, on my own and most recently Liferay.

Thanks for stopping by. I hope you find the content useful.
